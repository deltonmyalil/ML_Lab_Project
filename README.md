# ML_Lab_Project
You need to run the data retrieval script and wait till the 4GB data is downloaded.
This will only work if you retrieve the wiki processed data and not the raw data.

Also, the retrieved data, with just the titles are kept as csv for ipynb to work
See the data folder for it.

See the ipynb file on the EDA_and_Modeling folder for the workflow.
